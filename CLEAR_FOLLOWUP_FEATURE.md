# Clear Follow-Up Feature

## Overview
A clear follow-up function with modal has been added to the Circle Leader Profile Page. This feature allows users to easily clear follow-up requirements for circle leaders while documenting the reason for clearing the follow-up.

## Feature Location
- **Page**: Circle Leader Profile Page (`/app/circle/[id]/page.tsx`)
- **Section**: Follow-Up sidebar widget
- **Visibility**: Only visible when a circle leader has `follow_up_required = true`

## How It Works

### User Interface
1. When a circle leader has a follow-up requirement, the follow-up section in the sidebar shows:
   - Follow-up toggle button
   - Follow-up date input field
   - Follow-up status indicator (Overdue/Due Soon/Scheduled)
   - **NEW**: "Clear Follow-Up" button (red styling with X icon)

### Clear Follow-Up Process
1. User clicks the "Clear Follow-Up" button
2. A modal opens (`ClearFollowUpModal`) requiring:
   - A resolution note explaining why the follow-up is being cleared
   - Note is required (500 character limit)
3. Upon submission:
   - Sets `follow_up_required = false`
   - Sets `follow_up_date = null`
   - Adds a note to the circle leader's profile with the resolution explanation
   - Refreshes the page data to show updated status
   - Shows success message

### Implementation Details

#### Components Used
- **ClearFollowUpModal**: Existing reusable component from the dashboard
- **Modal**: Base modal component with proper styling
- **AlertModal**: For success/error feedback

#### Database Changes
- Updates `circle_leaders` table: `follow_up_required` and `follow_up_date` fields
- Inserts new record in `notes` table with resolution explanation

#### State Management
- `showClearFollowUpModal`: Controls modal visibility
- Proper error handling and loading states
- Automatic data refresh after successful operation

## Benefits
1. **Streamlined Workflow**: Users can clear follow-ups directly from the profile page
2. **Documentation**: Requires explanation for audit trail
3. **Consistent UX**: Uses existing modal patterns and styling
4. **Data Integrity**: Properly updates database and refreshes UI

## Integration
The feature integrates seamlessly with existing:
- Follow-up management system
- Notes system
- Authentication/authorization
- Error handling patterns
- Dark mode support

## Future Enhancements
- Bulk clear follow-ups from dashboard
- Follow-up history tracking
- Automated follow-up reminders
- Integration with calendar systems
