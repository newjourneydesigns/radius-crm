## Icon Requirements Summary

The following icon files should be placed in the `/icons/` directory:

### Required Icons
- **icon-16x16.png** - 16×16px (favicon)
- **icon-32x32.png** - 32×32px (navbar logo, favicon)
- **icon-192x192.png** - 192×192px (login page logo, PWA icon)
- **icon-512x512.png** - 512×512px (PWA icon, high-res)
- **apple-touch-icon.png** - 180×180px (iOS home screen)

- **apple-touch-icon-120x120.png** - 120×120px (iPhone)

### Design Recommendations
- **Format**: PNG with transparency for web icons, solid backgrounds for Apple touch icons
- **Style**: Simple, high-contrast design that works at small sizes
- **Colors**: Should work well on both light and dark backgrounds
- **Apple Touch Icons**: Use dark grey background (#374151 or similar) to ensure logo visibility on iOS
- **Content**: "RADIUS" text or "R" monogram with church branding

### Apple Touch Icon Background
iOS devices display Apple touch icons with the provided background color. Since iOS often uses light backgrounds, the Apple touch icons should have a **dark grey background (#374151)** to ensure the logo is visible against light interfaces.

The logo implementation is now complete and will display consistently throughout the application once the actual PNG files are added to the `/icons/` directory.
