# CCB Event Notes Integration - Complete Implementation Guide

## üéâ Implementation Status: COMPLETE ‚úÖ

The CCB (Church Community Builder) Event Notes integration has been successfully implemented and is fully functional in the Radius application.

## üìã What Was Accomplished

### 1. **CCB API Integration** 
- **File**: `/app/api/ccb/event-notes/route.ts`
- **Functionality**: Complete API endpoint that connects to CCB's REST API
- **Authentication**: Basic auth using environment variables
- **Endpoints Used**: `attendance_profile` (singular) with specific event IDs and occurrence dates
- **Strategy**: Two-phase approach:
  1. Fetch events from `event_profiles` to get event IDs and dates
  2. Call `attendance_profile` for each event with specific occurrence dates

### 2. **Frontend Component**
- **File**: `/components/dashboard/CCBEventNotes.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - Date range picker (defaults to last 30 days)
  - Loading states and error handling
  - Responsive design with dark/light mode support
  - Empty state messaging
  - Keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl/Cmd + Enter to search)
  - Beautiful event display with formatted dates and notes

### 3. **Database Schema**
- **Migration**: `/supabase/migrations/add_ccb_group_id.sql`
- **Field Added**: `ccb_group_id` TEXT field to `circle_leaders` table
- **TypeScript Interface**: Updated `CircleLeader` interface in `/lib/supabase.ts`

### 4. **Circle Leader Profile Integration**
- **File**: `/app/circle/[id]/page.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - CCB Group ID field in edit mode with helper text
  - Visual indicator when CCB integration is enabled
  - Automatic CCB Event Notes section display
  - Example working Group IDs provided (170, 285, 34)

## üîç Verified Working Data

### Group ID 170 - "FMT | S3 | Carla O'Hara"
- **Event Date**: January 28, 2025, 7:00 PM
- **Notes**: "Good discussion identifying where each of us joined the VCC story and shared experiences of the little and big things we have been a part of, i.e.: Serve The City, Lewisville campus launch, different service areas. All members had decided that VCC is my church and enjoy the conversations generated when wearing the t-shirt in public. We also discussed last week's message which practice each person chose for the year."

### Group ID 285 - "FMT | S3 | Lee and Beth Leibold"
- **Event Date**: January 19, 2025, 6:00 PM  
- **Notes**: "Our hope for our Circle is to support each other as we continue to grow as disciples of Christ. We discussed that most or all of the disciplines are closely related/inter-related, such as prayer, fasting, silence and solitude. Four members have decided to work on the discipline of scripture. While the others are planning to concentrate on prayer ‚Äî and at least one mentioned wanting to also couple that with fasting..."

## üöÄ How to Use

### For Circle Leaders:
1. Navigate to your Circle Leader profile page
2. Click the "Edit" button in the Circle Information section
3. Add your CCB Group ID in the "CCB Group ID" field
4. Save your changes
5. The CCB Event Notes section will appear below your profile
6. Use the date picker to select a range and click "Fetch Event Notes"

### For Administrators:
1. Ensure the following environment variables are set:
   - `CCB_BASE_URL=https://yourchurch.ccbchurch.com/api.php`
   - `CCB_API_USER=your_username`
   - `CCB_API_PASSWORD=your_password`

## üîß API Endpoints

### POST `/api/ccb/event-notes/`
**Purpose**: Fetch event notes from CCB for a specific group and date range

**Request Body**:
```json
{
  "groupId": "170",
  "startDate": "2025-01-01", 
  "endDate": "2025-12-31"
}
```

**Response**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "groupId": "170",
  "startDate": "2025-01-01",
  "endDate": "2025-12-31", 
  "eventNotes": [
    {
      "eventId": "12587",
      "eventName": "FMT | S3 | Carla O'Hara",
      "eventDate": "2025-01-28 19:00:00",
      "notes": "Good discussion identifying where each of us joined the VCC story..."
    }
  ],
  "totalEvents": 1,
  "source": "attendance_profile"
}
```

### GET `/api/ccb/event-notes/`
**Purpose**: Development endpoint that returns mock data for testing

## üìä Technical Details

### CCB API Limits:
- **Daily Limit**: 10,000 calls
- **Rate Limit**: 60 calls per minute  
- **Current Usage**: ~45 calls used during implementation testing

### Available Group IDs:
The system automatically discovers available group IDs from CCB events. Currently available (as of August 2025):
- Working with Notes: 170, 285
- Working but Empty Notes: 34, 35, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 55, 56
- And many more: 1178, 1747, 1748, 1749, 1750, 2163, 2234, etc.

### Date Range Filtering:
- Uses `modified_since` parameter to filter events
- Default range includes events modified since January 1, 2025
- Can be adjusted by changing the date picker range
